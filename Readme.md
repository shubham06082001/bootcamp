Creating and running a Maven application involves several steps. Maven is a popular build automation and project management tool used primarily for Java projects. Here's a general guide on how to create and run a Maven application:

**Step 1: Install Maven**
Make sure you have Maven installed on your system. You can download it from the official Apache Maven website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

**Step 2: Set Up a Project Directory**
Create a new directory for your project. This will be the root directory for your Maven project.

**Step 3: Create a Maven Project**
Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory you created in the previous step.

Run the following command to create a new Maven project:



* CREATE MAVEN APPLICATION -

mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false

* NAVIGATE -
  cd my-app
* BUILD -
  mvn clean install


* RUN THE APP -
  java -cp target/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
* CLEAN THE APP -
  mvn clean


Remember that Maven projects can vary in complexity, and this guide covers a basic setup. As your project evolves, you might need to configure dependencies, plugins, and other aspects in the `pom.xml` file, which is the project's configuration file.

For a more advanced project, you might want to explore different Maven plugins, set up a web application, or incorporate additional libraries.
